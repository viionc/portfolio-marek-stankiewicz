                I'm looking for a <strong>Junior Frontend Developer</strong> position. I strive to
                improve my skills every day. I look forward to working with experienced people from
                whom I can absorb knowledge and put it to use myself.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
                I focus more on the logic part of development. Optimizing functions or introducing
                new solutions to old projects that I learned along the way is what I enjoy the most.
                The possibility of <strong>constant improvement</strong> is what keeps me interested
                in this field.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
                While I may be a junior developer, I'm enthusiastic and ready to contribute to
                projects and help bring ideas to life.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
                If you are in need of someone who is ambitious, responsible, a fast learner, and
                very proficient in using Google I am the <strong>perfect candidate</strong>.
